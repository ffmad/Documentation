Within one week before voting period begins:</p><ul><li>Director candidate nominated. May self nominate, or be nominated by another individual. Each candidate must hold at least 50 XCP, which they will prove by signing a specific message (chosen by the Executive Director) with their private key.

The sum total of the values must be less than the XCP balance of the source address at the close of the voting period. A different text other than this may be used to avoid naming conflicts, and alternatively, the voting procedure detailed in CIP 005 may be used once implemented.</li></ul></li><li>Immediately after this two week voting period:<ul><li>Current Executive Director will tally and report on the results of the voting. The top five (5) candidate address with the highest number of votes will be announced as the winners of the election, and will receive the Director positions for the term of one (1) year from the date of the end of the voting period.</li></ul></li></ul><p>(b) Observers: Each director shall have the right to designate a single observer to attend Board of Directors meetings when such director is unable to be present. However, the director shall provide prior notice to the Chairman of the Board and the Chairman approves the request. Such a request shall not be unreasonably denied. An observer attending in place of a director shall have the right to fully participate in the general session, but may not vote on or put forth any motion.

Unless elected by written ballot pursuant to Section 4.9, the positions of directors then expiring shall be filled and elections held at the annual meeting of members called for such purpose.

If the selected runner-up is not interested in the seat, the runner-up with the next highest voted XCP stake shall be offered the seat, and so on, until an interested runner-up is identified. If there is no such interested runner-up or this process is otherwise inapplicable, a new XCP stake voting procedure shall be held to fill the vacant seat.</p><p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, if these Bylaws are amended to expand the number of directors representing a membership class, the Board of Directors may appoint an interim director representing such class until the members of such class elect a director. Each director shall hold office until his or her successor is elected. A vacancy shall be deemed to exist in the following situations:</p><p>(a) Death, resignation, or removal of any director;</p><p>(b) An increase in the authorized number of directors without election of the additional directors so provided for;</p><p>(c) Failure to elect the full number of authorized directors;</p><p>(d) As provided in the last sentence of this Section 5.4.

The action shall be evidenced by one or more written consents that:</p><p>(a) Describe the action taken;</p><p>(b) Are signed by each director; and</p><p>(c) Are included in the minutes or filed with the corporate records reflecting the action taken.</p><p>Action taken in accordance with this section is effective when the last director signs the consent, unless the consent specifies an earlier or later effective date. Any consent signed hereunder has the effect of a meeting vote and may be described as such in any document.</p><p>##Section 5.10 Meetings Held via Electronic Communications Technology:</p><p>The Board of Directors may permit any or all directors to participate in a regular or special meeting by, or conduct the meeting through, use of any means of communication by which all participating directors may simultaneously read or hear each substantially concurrently with their occurrence, vote on matters submitted to the members, pose questions, and make comments.

Every act or decision done or made by a majority of the directors present at a meeting duly held at which a quorum is present shall be regarded as the act of the Board of Directors, unless a greater number is required by law, the Articles, or these Bylaws.</p><p>##Section 5.12 Fees and Compensation:</p><p>The Board of Directors, by resolution, may provide for compensation and reimbursement to directors and members of committees for their services and expenses. However, such compensation must be reasonable and comparable to compensation paid by unaffiliated entities for a similar position. Nothing herein shall preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity, including as an officer, agent, employee, consultant, or otherwise, and receiving reasonable compensation for such service.</p><p>##Section 5.13 Indemnity:</p><p>The Corporation shall indemnify its directors to the fullest extent allowed by sections 29-406.51 and 29-406.52 of the State of Delaware Official Code, or any corresponding section(s) of any future official State of Delaware code.</p><p>##Section 5.14 Standard of Conduct:</p><p>In accordance with section 29-406.30 of the State of Delaware Official Code, or any corresponding section(s) of any future official State of Delaware code, a director shall discharge the duties of a director, including duties as a member of any committee on which the director may serve, in good faith, in a manner the director reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the Corporation, and with the care a person in a like position would reasonably believe appropriate under similar circumstances. In discharging the duties of a director, a director shall be entitled to rely on information, opinions, reports or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, in each case if prepared or presented by:</p><p>(a) One or more officers or employees of the Corporation whom the director reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented;</p><p>(b) Legal counsel, public accountants, or other persons as to matters the director reasonably believes are within the person&#x27;s professional or expert competence and as to which the particular person merits confidence; or</p><p>(c) A Board committee which the director is not a member, as to matters within the committee&#x27;s jurisdiction, if the director reasonably believes the committee merits confidence.</p><p>A director is not acting in good faith if he or she has knowledge concerning the matter in question that makes reliance otherwise permitted in this Section 5.14 unwarranted.

As used herein this Section 5.15, a &quot;conflict of interest transaction&quot; is a transaction with the Corporation in which a director of the Corporation has a direct or indirect interest. An indirect interest exists where: </p><ul><li>(i) another entity in which the director has a material interest, or in which the director is a general partner, is a party to the transaction; or </li><li>(ii) if another entity of which the director is a director, officer, or trustee is a party to the transaction and the transaction is or should be considered by the Corporation&#x27;s Board of Directors.</li></ul><p>(b) Approval. A conflict of interest transaction is not always voidable or the basis for imposing liability on the director. The transaction is not voidable or the basis for director liability if it is fair to the corporation at the time it was entered into, or is approved either: (i) in advance by a vote of the Board of Directors, or a Board of Directors committee, and the material facts of the transaction and the director&#x27;s interest were disclosed or known to the Board or committee; or (ii) if the material facts of the transaction and the director&#x27;s interest were disclosed or known to the members and they authorized, approved, or ratified the transaction. Such authorization, approval, or ratification of a conflict of interest transaction can occur as follows:</p><ul><li>(i) By Directors. By the Board of Directors, if the conflict of interest transaction receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors on the Board or committee who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction. However, a conflict of interest transaction may not be so authorized, approved, or ratified by a single director. If a majority of the directors with no direct or indirect interest in the transaction votes to authorize, approve, or ratify the transaction, a quorum is present for the purpose of taking such action. The presence of, or a vote cast by, a director with a direct or indirect interest in the transaction does not affect the validity of the authorization, approval, or ratification, if the transaction is otherwise approved as permitted by law.</li><li>(ii) By Members. By the members of the Corporation if the conflict of interest transaction receives a majority of the votes entitled to be counted. Votes cast by or voted under the control of a director who has a direct or indirect interest in the transaction may be counted in such a vote to authorize, approve, or ratify a conflict of interest transaction. A majority of the members, whether or not present, that are entitled to be counted in a vote on the transaction constitutes a quorum for the purpose of taking such action.</li></ul><p>##Section 5.16 Resignation and Removal:</p><p>(a) Resignation.
